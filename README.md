# win_dev
This is my default C:\dev when setting up a new windows box.

Checkout as C:\dev and then make sure you ignore any actual projects.

TODO:
1. Git & git bash with junction to program files(x86)
2. .gitconfig in ~ or in git install dir?
2. unlocker
3. clipx with junctions to startup
4. conemu junction to startup
5. vim / vim files in ~ (junctions?)
6. .bashrc in ~ (junctions?)
7. Puppet instead of scripting to set this up?
8. Is Console2 actually needed?
